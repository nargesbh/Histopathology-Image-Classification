## Introduction
Welcome to the Deep Learning Image Classification Project! This repository contains code and information about various deep learning models for image classification. We have explored different model architectures and evaluated their performance on a specific dataset.

## Project Overview
In this project, we have:

- Explored various deep learning models for image classification.
- Trained and evaluated these models on a custom dataset.
- Compared the performance of different model architectures.
- Provided detailed insights into the project's results.

## Dataset
If you are interested in accessing the dataset used in this project, please send an email to [Nargesbabaahmadi7@gmail.com](mailto:Nargesbabaahmadi7@gmail.com). We'll be happy to provide you with the dataset upon request.

## Library Requirements

Before running the code in this repository, make sure you have the following libraries and dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 
- Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Pillow (PIL)
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

```
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow seaborn
```

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.
3. Explore the code in the various Jupyter notebooks provided.
4. Run the notebooks to train and evaluate different deep learning models.

## Model Architectures
We have experimented with the following model architectures:

1. **Homework Model**: The initial model provided for the assignment.
2. **Architecture #1**: An updated model with modified convolutional layers.
3. **ResNet50**: A pre-trained ResNet-50 model fine-tuned for our classification task.


## Performance Metrics
We have measured the performance of each model using various metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Specificity
- Confusion Matrix

You can find the performance results in the respective notebook file.
